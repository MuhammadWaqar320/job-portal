I have gained a good reputation for my attention to detail on the usability aspects of websites, my creative
problem solving skills and refreshing approach to my projects. As a full stack developer, I stand out because I
am able to create a full working website. So I understand both design principles and coding, which pushes me
to strive in making my coding always come out semantically, practical and in the most efficient way possible.
